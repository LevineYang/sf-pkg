\section Introduction 

For more details see \cite Wel06 and \cite Gre08.

A Kalman filter uses the physical model of a system (the plant) to
estimate the new value of a statistical variable. For this problem the
system is described by a difference equation (state space model; this
notation is used for estimation and control systems). The following
formula, called state transition model or process model describes this
system or discrete-time controlled process:

\f[ x_k = Ax_{k-1} + Bu_{k-1} + w_{k-1} \f]

- \f$x_k\f$ state vector on current step k (includes \f$n\f$ state
  variables of the dynamic system)
- A system or transition matrix which relates previous state to
  current state
- u control input (optional)
- B input matrix which relates the control input u to the state x
- w random variable whichrepresents the process noise

The measurement model describes the relation of the state and
the measurements:

\f[ z_k = Hx_k + v_k \f]

- z measurement vector (sometimes also called the innovation vector)
- H output or observation matrix relates state x to measurement z
  (also called measurement sensitivity matrix)
- v random variable which represents the measurement noise

There are several assumptions which are made in practice. The noise in
process and measurement model are white, have normal probability
distributions with process noise covariance Q and measurement noise
covariance R and are independent from each other.

\f[ p(w) \sim N(0,Q) \f]
\f[ p(v) \sim N(0,R) \f]
